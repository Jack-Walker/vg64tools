#summary Overview of content in our repository.

= Introduction =

Our repository contains both tools for N64 games and code the games themselves can use.




= Code for games =
Hacks and toolchains for changing how games work.

==GNU Toolchain==
Scripts used to set up the MIPS-GCC toolchain used to compile C hacks for N64 games.

==toolmode==
Hack for the Debugger's version of OoT Master Quest that allows the user to make changes in-game and save those changes to the gamesave, so they appear the next time the user goes to the area the made the changes in.<br>

==z64-actors==
Actors from the Debugger's build of OoT Master Quest that are or are being re-written in C.
===En_Bird===
Beta bird. Successfully re-written in C, though the animation plays a bit fast. A branch of it flies in a broken circle.
===En_Dodojr===
Baby dodongo. Very little progress thus far, only a few functions successfully work in C.
==z64actor==
Not to be confused with z64-actors, this is a hack for the 1.0 version of OoT that can spawn actors on demand.
==z64vr==
A hack for the Debugger's version of OoT Master Quest that replaces all vowels in in-game dialog to "o"s.<br>
